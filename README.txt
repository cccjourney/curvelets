This software package includes two tools, i.e. CurveAlign and CT-FIRE for collagen fiber quantification. CurveAlign is a quantitative tool for interpreting the regional interaction between collagen and tumors by assessment of up to ~thirty fiber features, including angle, alignment, and density. CT-FIRE analyzes individual fiber metrics such as length, width, angle, and curvature. The individual fibers extracted by CT-FIRE can be imported into the CurveAlign as one of the two fiber analyse modes. For now, CurveAlign should be used for bulk assessment of collagen features including angles/density and CT-FIRE for individual fiber quantification.

CurveAlign and CT-FIRE are licensed under the 2-Clause BSD license as described LICENSE.txt, except for some third-party code whose licenses are described in LICENSE-third-party.txt. One third-party code, CurveLab 2.1.2 MATLAB package for curvelet transform, can only be downloaded from http://www.curvelet.org/software.html. To run CurveAlign or CT-FIRE, the CurveLab needs to be downloaded and added to the Matlab searching path.
